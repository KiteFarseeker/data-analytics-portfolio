# Spotify Listening Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains my Spotify Listening Data Analysis project, where I explore and visualize my listening habits using Tableau and other tools. The dataset is based on my complete streaming history from Spotify and includes details such as artists, tracks, playtime, and more.

## Contents

- **Data Preparation**: Refer to [Spotify Report](https://github.com/KiteFarseeker/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/spotify_project/report/spotify_data_report.md) for insights on how the data was acquired, prepared, and managed.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Top 10 Artists and Tracks by Year
  - Artist/Track Popularity Over Time
  - Listening Heatmaps (Daily/Monthly Trends)
  - Artist Loyalty Analysis
  - Hidden Gems Analysis (Low-Playtime Artists with High Impact)
- **Work In Progress**: Genre-related visualizations and advanced insights yet to be added.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

1. Uncover patterns in my listening habits.
2. Practice data visualization techniques.
3. Showcase my skills in Tableau and data storytelling.

## Data Privacy
